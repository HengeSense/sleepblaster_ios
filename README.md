Sleep Blaster for iOS
================

Sleep Blaster for iPhone and iPad is an alarm clock app that allows the user to set an alarm at a geographical boundary instead of just a time. It also allows the user to turn off the alarm using his or her voice. 

This project was written to be compatible with iOS 3 and iOS 4. As of June 2012 however, I have retired development on the project and removed it from the App Store due to personal time constraints. Thus, there are now incompatibilities with iOS versions higher than 4.1, however most of these incompatibilities are only interface related.
